  topic: "Polymorphic association",
  definition: %{
With polymorphic associations, a model can belong to more than one other model, on a single association. For example, you might have a picture model that belongs to either an employee model or a product model. You can think of a polymorphic belongs_to declaration as setting up an interface that any other model can use.

  topic: "Single Table Inheritance",
  definition: %{
Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a column that by default is named "type" (can be changed by overwriting Base.inheritance_column). This means that an inheritance looking like this:

    class Company < ActiveRecord::Base; end
    class Firm < Company; end
    class Client < Company; end
    class PriorityClient < Client; end

When you do `Firm.create(name: "37signals")`, this record will be saved in the companies table with `type = "Firm"`. You can then fetch this row again using `Company.where(name: '37signals').first` and it will return a Firm object.

If you don't have a type column defined in your table, single-table inheritance won't be triggered. In that case, it'll work just like normal subclasses with no special magic for differentiating between them or reloading the right type with find.

Note, all the attributes for all the cases are kept in the same table.

  topic: "ActiveSupport::Inflector",
  definition: %{
The Inflector transforms words from singular to plural, class names to table names, modularized class names to ones without, and class names to foreign keys. The default inflections for pluralization, singularization, and uncountable words are kept in `inflections.rb`.

  topic: "Active Record Callbacks",
  definition: %{
Callbacks are methods that get called at certain moments of an object's life cycle. With callbacks it is possible to write code that will run whenever an Active Record object is created, saved, updated, deleted, validated, or loaded from the database.

### Creating an Object
* `before_validation`
* `after_validation`
* `before_save`
* `around_save`
* `before_create`
* `around_create`
* `after_create`
* `after_save`
* `after_commit`/`after_rollback`

### Updating an Object
* `before_validation`
* `after_validation`
* `before_save`
* `around_save`
* `before_update`
* `around_update`
* `after_update`
* `after_save`
* `after_commit`/`after_rollback`

### Destroying an Object
* `before_destroy`
* `around_destroy`
* `after_destroy`

  topic: "Mock Objects",
  definition: %{
In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts.

In a unit test, mock objects can simulate the behavior of complex, real objects and are therefore useful when a real object is impractical or impossible to incorporate into a unit test.

Classification between mocks, fakes, and stubs is highly inconsistent across literature. Consistent among the literature, though, is that they all represent a production object in a testing environment by exposing the same interface.

Example: Mocha asynchronous test framework for JS
