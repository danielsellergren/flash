  topic: "Polymorphic association",
  definition: %{
With polymorphic associations, a model can belong to more than one other model, on a single association. For example, you might have a picture model that belongs to either an employee model or a product model. You can think of a polymorphic belongs_to declaration as setting up an interface that any other model can use.

  topic: "Single Table Inheritance",
  definition: %{
Active Record allows inheritance by storing the name of the class in a column that by default is named "type" (can be changed by overwriting Base.inheritance_column). This means that an inheritance looking like this:

    class Company < ActiveRecord::Base; end
    class Firm < Company; end
    class Client < Company; end
    class PriorityClient < Client; end

When you do `Firm.create(name: "37signals")`, this record will be saved in the companies table with `type = "Firm"`. You can then fetch this row again using `Company.where(name: '37signals').first` and it will return a Firm object.

If you don't have a type column defined in your table, single-table inheritance won't be triggered. In that case, it'll work just like normal subclasses with no special magic for differentiating between them or reloading the right type with find.

Note, all the attributes for all the cases are kept in the same table.

  topic: "Mock Objects",
  definition: %{
In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts.

In a unit test, mock objects can simulate the behavior of complex, real objects and are therefore useful when a real object is impractical or impossible to incorporate into a unit test.

Classification between mocks, fakes, and stubs is highly inconsistent across literature. Consistent among the literature, though, is that they all represent a production object in a testing environment by exposing the same interface.

Example: Mocha asynchronous test framework for JS

  topic: "Railties",
  definition: %(
All major components of Rails are created as a subclass of `Rails::Railtie`. For example, Active Record (which handles query syntax to a database) and Action Controller (which handles the base controller logic) are both Railties. `Railtie` is an abstract class which is not meant for instantiation, and even throws an error on the `#initialize` method unless it's overwritten in a subclass. Other methods on the `Railtie` class include `#rake_tasks`, `#console`, `#runner`, and `#generators`.

  topic: "Antipattern",

According to the authors of Design Patterns, there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:

1. A commonly used process, structure or pattern of action that despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and effective response to a problem, typically has more bad consequences than beneficial results, and
2. A good alternative solution exists that is documented, repeatable and proven to be effective.

  topic: "Foreign Key",
  definition: %(
A foreign key is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. The purpose of the foreign key is to ensure referential integrity of the data. In other words, only values that are supposed to appear in the database are permitted. For example a `Book` might have an `author_id` that contains the unique primary key of the Author so that they are linked.

Rails supports database-enforced foreign keys as of version 4.2.

Rack provides a modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses it unifies the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call.

Rack is used by many Ruby web frameworks and libraries, such as Ruby On Rails and Sinatra. It is available as a Ruby Gem.

  topic: "Active Job",
  definition: %(
Active Job is a framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queuing backends. These jobs can be everything from regularly scheduled clean-ups, to billing charges, to mailings. Anything that can be chopped up into small units of work and run in parallel, really.

The main point is to ensure that all Rails apps will have a job infrastructure in place. We can then have framework features and other gems build on top of that, without having to worry about API differences between various job runners such as Delayed Job and Resque. Picking your queuing backend becomes more of an operational concern, then. And you'll be able to switch between them without having to rewrite your jobs.

  topic: "Duck Typing",
  definition: %(
In computer programming with object-oriented programming languages, duck typing is a layer of programming language and design rules on top of typing. Typing is concerned with assigning a type to any object. Duck typing is concerned with establishing the suitability of an object for some purpose. With normal typing, suitability is assumed to be determined by an object's type only. In duck typing, an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties (with appropriate meaning), rather than the actual type of the object.

The name of the concept refers to the duck test, attributed to James Whitcomb Riley, which may be phrased as follows:

> When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.

In duck typing, a programmer is only concerned with ensuring that objects behave as demanded of them in a given context, rather than ensuring that they are of a specific class. For example, in a non-duck-typed language, one would create a function that requires that the object passed into it be of type Duck, or descended from type Duck, in order to ensure that that function can then use the object's walk and quack methods. In a duck-typed language, the function would take an object of any type and simply call its walk and quack methods, producing a run-time error if they are not defined. Instead of specifying types formally, duck typing practices rely on documentation, clear code, and testing to ensure correct use.

    class Duck
      def quack
        puts "Quaaaaaack!"
      end

      def feathers
        puts "The duck has white and gray feathers."
      end
    end

    class Person
      def quack
        puts "The person imitates a duck."
      end

      def feathers
        puts "The person takes a feather from the ground and shows it."
      end
    end

  topic: "String #{ 'interpolation' }",
  definition: %(
In computer programming, string interpolation or variable interpolation (also variable substitution or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values. It is a form of simple template processing, or, in formal terms, a form of Quasi-quotation (or logic substitution interpretation). String interpolation allows for easier and more intuitive string formatting and content-specification compared with string concatenation.

    apples = 4
    puts "I have #{apples} apples"
    # or
    puts "I have %s apples" % apples
    # or
    puts "I have %{a} apples" % {a: apples}

The output will be:

    I have 4 apples
